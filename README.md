# CivicLink

The project is a civic engagement app designed to link individuals and communities by making it easier to participate in local events, discussions, and initiatives. The app allows users to discover and register for civic activities, connect with others in their community, and access educational resources to stay informed and engaged. With features like event tracking, community forums, and personalized notifications, the app aims to create a more active and informed community.

Interactive maps showing event locations, community centers, and civic resources nearby the userâ€™s area.  Tailored opportunities/events for users based on their skills, interests, and availability, also enabling users to share events, discussions, and resources on social media platforms to raise awareness and encourage others to participate. Personal dashboard where users can track the events they've attended and their level of civic engagement, and group chat features for organizing team efforts around specific events or causes.
